### AI Bias Busters

**Objective:** The purpose of this game is to understand and recognize biases that AI systems may have. The game is designed to be educational and engaging, encouraging participants to think critically about AI bias.

#### Number of Players

- 5 to 10 players.

#### Setup

1. **Materials Needed:**
   - A deck of "Scenario Cards" (various situations where AI is used).
   - A deck of "Bias Cards" (various types of biases that AI may exhibit).
   - A timer (a phone timer or stopwatch will do).
   - A notepad and pen for each player (optional).

#### Gameplay

1. **Introduction (5 minutes):**
   - Explain the purpose of the game: to learn about and identify different types of biases in AI systems.
   - Briefly describe what AI bias is and how it can affect decisions and outcomes.

2. **Drawing Scenario Cards (3 minutes):**
   - Shuffle the deck of Scenario Cards and place it face down in the center.
   - Each player draws one Scenario Card and reads it aloud to the group. 

3. **Discussion Round (10 minutes per scenario):**
   - For each scenario, players discuss the potential biases that could be present
     - Players should consider the following questions during the discussion:
     - What kind of data is the AI using?
     - Who created the data, and how might it be biased?
     - How is the AI making its decisions?
     - Who is affected by these decisions?
     - Are there any groups who might be disproportionately affected?

4. **Drawing Bias Cards (3 minutes):**
   - Shuffle the deck of Bias Cards and place it face down in the center.
   - Each player draws one Bias Card. Each Bias Card describes a specific type of AI bias (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Selection Bias, Automation Bias, etc.).
   - Players take turns reading the Bias Cards aloud and explaining the type of bias as it relates to AI.

5. **Bias Identification Round (10 minutes per scenario):**
   - After each Scenario Card discussion, players collaboratively discuss whether any of the bias types from the Bias Cards apply to the scenario.
   - If players identify a bias that matches one or more Bias Cards, they place those Bias Cards next to the Scenario Card.
   - Players can choose to take notes about their observations and conclusions on the notepad.

6. **Scoring (Optional):**
   - Players can score points for correctly identifying biases. Each identified and agreed upon bias gives a point to the player who spotted it.
   - Having a designated "moderator" can help keep the game fair and ensure that discussions stay on track.

7. **Reflection Round (10 minutes):**
   - Once all Scenario Cards have been discussed and biases identified, the group reflects on what they've learned.
   - Some guiding questions for reflection:
     - What surprised you about the biases you identified?
     - How do you think these biases could be mitigated?
     - How can awareness of AI bias influence how we use technology in daily life?

8. **Conclusion (5 minutes):**
   - Summarize the key takeaways from the game.
   - Encourage players to continue learning about AI and its impact on society.
   - Discuss ways individuals and organizations can contribute to creating fairer and less biased AI systems.

#### Example Cards

**Scenario Cards:**
- **Scenario 1:** "A facial recognition system used for security has a higher error rate for people with darker skin tones."
- **Scenario 2:** "An AI recruitment tool that filters out resumes based on specific keywords which predominantly feature in male-dominated fields."
- **Scenario 3:** "A predictive policing algorithm that disproportionately targets certain neighborhoods based on historically biased crime data."

**Bias Cards:**
- **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or values.
- **Selection Bias:** The bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved.
- **Automation Bias:** The propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore contradictory information.
